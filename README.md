# Movie Lens Recommender
This is a class project developed for a course from Simon Fraser University's master of professional computer science program.
Like the original Movie Lens system developed by a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, this is a personalized recommender system aiming to deliver good UX when navigating through a large repository of contents (movies/videos).

## Problem definition
* The scale of the content repository: 10^6.
* The number of active users in the system: 10^7.
* Must achieve high precision.
* Under resonable cost, 95th percentile latency should be kept below 1 second.
